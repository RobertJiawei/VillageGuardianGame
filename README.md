# Village Guardian
---

**Description**:

"Village Guardian" in a low-poly game that I designed as the final projectvideo of a game development course, where player take on the role of a protector defednign a village under siege. I develop the game using the Unity Engine and made use of pre-packaged assets for the character and enemy models. The game desing focused on the user experience with intuitive controls for both the mouse and keyboard. I also implemented various character animations including idle, defend, attack, walk, run, victory, get hit, and die, to create a rich and responsive gameplay experience.

**Gameplay Features:**
- *Dynamic Levels*: Designed multiple levels with escalating difficulty, each populated with different enemy types challenging the player's defense strategies.
- *Character Customization*: Allowed character selection from multiple options, enhancing player engagement and personalization.
- *Health and Combat*: Implemented a health system for both the player and enemies, with direct combat dynamics influencing the survival and progression through the levels.
- *Navigation*: Included a mini-map for strategic overview, aiding players in situational awareness and tactical planning.
- *Resource Management*: Created medic supply stations within the game to recover health, adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.

**Game Mechanics:**
- *Enemy AI*: Developed AI for enemies with behavior patterns including attacking the player and retreating towards the village, based on the player's proximity.
- *Pause and Control*: Integrated an in-game pause menu with options to resume, restart, or exit, providing players with flexible control over their gaming experience.
